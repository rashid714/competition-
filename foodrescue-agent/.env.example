# GOOGLE GEMINI API KEY SETUP
# 1. Go to https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# 2. Click "Create API key"
# 3. Copy the key and paste below
# 4. RENAME THIS FILE TO '.env' (remove the .example)

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"



# SECURITY: Do NOT commit your real API key. Rename this file to `.env` and
# add `.env` to your `.gitignore` so your key isn't checked into version control.
# If you have already pasted a real key here or in chat, rotate/revoke it immediately.
